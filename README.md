# Newspapers
  I developed an ios app to views first pages of Turkish daily newspapers.

********************
  The app download the first pages of newspaper from Internet and allow user to navigate between them through sliding gesture. 
App download each image once in a day, and store locally. When the user requests the same pictures again the app use local copy of the image file instead of redownloading from Internet. Beside, user can choose which newspaper to see and in which order. 
********************
  Ability to store past images and show selecting past dates as user select through user interface. Share pages through Facebook
